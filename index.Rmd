# Preamble
___

## The course material

Course materials prepared at Hafró are open source, meaning that presentations, code, etc is made freely available and may be
redistributed and modified (with wich license these pages' framework
is lifted from 'http://github.com/fishvice/tcrenv').

* The source code for the course material is located at:
  https://github.com/sigurdurthorjonsson/lsss_course

* The course product will be rendered LATER IN MARCH and during APRIL at:
  http://www.hafro.is/~sigurdur/lsss_course
  
__NOTE This does not apply automatically data sets and IMR materials__ _CHECK_WITH Rolf for the IMR course materials, and owners of data_  

## In preparation

The aim of the course is to train Hafró-personnel in the use of the
acoustic post-processing program LSSS (for Large Scale Survey
System). The program is written and maintained by Marec, a
collaboration between Havforskningen/IMR and Christian Michelsen
Research/CMR in Bergen. The software is licenced and the user
generally has to have a licence dongle on the machine running the
program.
 
**Prior to the course** please try to install:

* LSSS version 2.3.0, for a local install follow Gunnar Örvarsson's instructions:

    - Windows: Windows version of LSSS 2.3.0 is available on a
      package-directory, m:\inst\lsss on shore on server hafkaldi, on
      board the vessels on server stórsjór (on Árni) or úthaf (on
      Bjarni)).

    - linux: Linux version can be updated to 2.3.0 (as root) with:

> cd /net/hafkaldi.hafro.is/opt/hafkaldi/local/src/linux

> make lsss-update

    - Mac, go figure, ...

Hafró has 5 dongles which can be borrowed for periods of time not
colliding with high acoustic survey activity (January/February,
September/October). __Marec/IMR in Bergen will open up for dongle-less
use of the program in April.__

For those that want to get a head we recommend the following reading material:

  * Simmonds & MacLennan's Fisheries Acoustics [@simmonds2005]
  * The ICES calibration CRR [@demer2015]
  * Rolf _et al._'s recent paper on categorization with LSSS [@korneliussen2017]

## Collection of material from previous courses and acoustic data on Hafró-net

Acoustic data and course materials from previous LSSS-courses, held both at Hafró and at IMR, Bergen, are available on file server Hafrún, accessible as `/u5/bergmal` in linux, Windows users can gain access by typing in `\\hafrun\u5\` in the address bar of Windows File Explorer and then descend into the folder `bergmal`. 

### LSSS-course materials

Course materials from a course held at IMR in Bergen in Febrary 2018
are are available, courtesy of Rolf Korneliussen and colleagues, in
folder:

`LSSS_namskeid/LSSS_Bergen_Feb_2018`

with 4 sub-directories pdf-s of help files and presentations:


- `1_LSSS_CURRENT_VERSION/DOCUMENTATION_LSSS_2_3_0_rc` with PDF-help accompanying LSSS and its modules,


- ` 2_ACOUSTICS` has materials on acoustics and application in fisheries research

- `3_LSSS_BASIC` has extensive materials regarding basic use of LSSS suitable for selfstudy during eastet :-), and finally

- `4_LSSS_ADVANCED` has course materials from the advanced part of an LSSS-course

### A significant proportion of the acoustic data collection of
    Hafró is available in the directory `EK60raw`, organized in
    subfolders by survey (`[AB]YYYY_NR`, where [AB] is denotes survey
    vessel). Course/workshop participants can locate surveys of
    interest, copy them to their personal drives and set up analysis
    in LSSS.

 
# A draft workplan
___

## Part I
___

The course will be held in the meeting room on the first floor, there
is space for 10-15 people, on an 'early bird gets a seat' basis. Bring
your lap- or desktop. The preliminary plan is to meet at
__13:00-16:00__ on days the course is given / we meet for a
workshop. _Note that the themes and intitals are tentative, and we may
shuffle things around._

## Part II or to be continued
___

Prior to multi-vessels surveys we will aim for 1/2- or 1-day crash courses for the personnel manning the aocustic intstruments.

We'll probably get instructors from IMR/Marec for an LSSS-course in the not to distant future. 

Here are some aspects of LSSS and acoustic data collection and house-keeping that need to be considered:

* [Utilization of sonar in fisheries research](404page.html)

* [Broad-band capable echosounders, big data](404page.html)

* [Standardizing Hafró/MFRI processing of acoustics data](404.html)

* [Central DB of survey results, read-only](404.html)

* [Testing out Deep Vision acoustic integration with LSSS](https://www.deepvision.no/deep-vision-acoustic-integration)

* ...

# Preamble

### The course material

Course materials are open source, meaning that all materials, i.e. presentations, code, etc is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified (with wich license these pages' framework is lifted from 'http://github.com/fishvice/tcrenv').

* The source code for the course material is located at: https://github.com/sigurdurthorjonsson/lsss_course
* The course product is rendered at: http://www.hafro.is/~sigurdur/lsss_course

### In preparation

The aim of the course is to train Hafró-personnel in the use of the
acoustic post-processing program LSSS (for Large Scale Survey
System). The program is written and maintained by Marec, a
collaboration between Havforskningen/IMR and Christian Michelsen
Research/CMR in Bergen. The software is licenced and the user
generally has to have a licence dongle on the machine running the
program.
 
**Prior to the course** please try to install:

* LSSS version 2.3.0, for a local install follow Gunnar Örvarsson's instructions:
    - Windows: Windows version of LSSS 2.3.0 is available on a package-directory, m:\inst\lsss on shore on server hafkaldi, on board the vessels on server stórsjór (on Árni) or úthaf (on Bjarni)).

    - linux: Linux version can be updated to 2.3.0 (as root) with:

> cd /net/hafkaldi.hafro.is/opt/hafkaldi/local/src/linux

> make lsss-update

    - Mac, go figure, ...

Hafró has 5 dongles which can be borrowed for periods of time not
colliding with high acoustic survey activity (January/February,
September/October). __Marec/IMR in Bergen will open up for dongle-less
use of the program in April.__

For those that want to get a head we recommend the following reading material:

  * Simmonds & MacLennan's Fisheries Acoustics [@simmonds2005]
  * The ICES calibration CRR [@demer2015]
  * Rolf _et al._'s recent paper on categorization with LSSS [@korneliussen2017]

# A draft workplan
___

## Part I
___

The course will be held in the meeting room on the first floor, there
is space for 10-15 people, on an 'early bird gets a seat' basis. Bring
your lap- or desktop. The preliminary plan is to meet at __13:00-16:00__ on days the course is given or we meet for a workshop. _Note that the themes and intitals are tentative, and we may shuffle things around._

* [Standardizing Hafró/MFRI processing of acoustics data](404.html) - nn
* [Central DB of survey results, read-only](404.html) - nn
* ...

## Addendums

* [Bits and pieces](404.html) - collection of stuff made in the follow-up to the course and workshop.
